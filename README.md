# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-and-Heirarchical-Clustering
Recency,Frequency,Monetary (RFM) segmentation of Customers using clustering Algorithm

The data consists of certain attributes wrt the goos purchase transaction details of customers, we need to ascertain whether the data has clustering tendency,
optimum number of clusters required and classifying the customers among the clusters with labels.

I have also illustrated how we determine the clustering tendency using Hopkin's Test statistic.
I have also used the elbow curve method (SSD) and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
